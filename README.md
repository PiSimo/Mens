# How does it work?
The game is made of different questions each of them returns a score. All the scores are passed to a neural network (along with age, gender, test time) that computes the final score.

# Status
Currently the project is not on the play store yet. <br />Because of some compatibility issues with android 5.0/5.11, and beacause we are trying to increase the nn accuracy.<br />
But it works fine on Marshmallow and Nougat, if you want to try the app you can install this <a href="https://github.com/PiSimo/Mens/raw/master/apk/app-flavorRelease-release.apk">apk</a>.<br/>

# Help us
